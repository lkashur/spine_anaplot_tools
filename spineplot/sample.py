    Attributes
    ----------
    _name : str
        The name of the sample.
    _exposure_type : str
        The exposure type for the sample. This can be either 'pot' or
        'livetime'.
    _file_handle : uproot.reading.ReadOnlyDirectory
        The file handle for the input ROOT file.
    _exposure_pot : float
        The exposure of the sample in POT.
    _exposure_livetime : float
        The exposure of the sample in livetime.
    _category_branch : str
        The name of the branch in the TTree containing the category
        labels.
    _data : pd.DataFrame
        The data comprising the sample.

        """
        Initializes the Sample object with the given name and key.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str
            The name of the sample.
        rf : uproot.reading.ReadOnlyDirectory
            The file handle for the input ROOT file.
        category_branch : str
            The name of the branch in the TTree containing the category
            labels. This categorical information is referenced in the
            configuration file to designate specific components of the
            sample and apply different styles to them.
        key : str
            The key/name of the TDirectory in the ROOT file input
            containing the sample data.
        exposure_type : str
            The exposure type for the sample. This can be either 'pot'
            or 'livetime'. This is used for matching the exposure of
            the sample to the target sample.
        trees : list
            The list of TTree names in the ROOT file to load for the
            sample.
        precompute : dict, optional
            A dictionary of new branches to compute from the existing
            branches in the sample. The keys are the names of the new
            branches and the values are the expressions to compute the
            new branches. The default is None.
        presel : str, optional
            A pre-selection string to apply to the sample data. The
            default is None.
        override_category : int
            The category to override the category branch with if it is
            configured. Else, the category branch is left as is.

        Returns
        -------
