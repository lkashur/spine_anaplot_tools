class Systematic:
    """
    A class designed to encapsulate the systematic uncertainty on a Sample
    due to a single source of uncertainty. A few types of systematic
    uncertainties are supported:
    - Statistical uncertainty: The uncertainty due to the finite size of
        the sample. This is calculated using a simple sqrt(N)/N formula.
    - Multisim uncertainty: The uncertainty due to the variation of
        parameters in the simulation. This is calculated by generating
        a set of universes and calculating the covariance matrix for
        the systematic parameter. The weights for the universes are
        stored in a TTree by code external to this tool.
    - Multisigma uncertainty: The uncertainty due to the variation of
        parameters in the simulation. This is calculated by generating
        a set of universes and calculating the covariance matrix for
        the systematic parameter. The weights are stored in a TTree by
        code external to this tool as "n-sigma" weights. This class
        interpolates the weights at the desired sigma level to generate
        a set of universe weights.

    The Systematic object is designed to be used in conjunction with the
    Sample object. The Sample object contains the data for the analysis
    and critically the exposure information. All systematic
    uncertainties must be rescaled to the target exposure before being
    used in an analysis. This class provides a method to rescale the
    covariance matrices to ensure that the systematic uncertainties are
    properly treated.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _name : str
        The name of the systematic uncertainty.
    _label : str
        The label of the systematic uncertainty. Intended to be used in
        plots for identifying the systematic parameter.
    _handle : uproot.models.TBranch.Model_TBranchElement
        The handle to the branch containing the weights for the
        systematic parameter.
    _variables : dict
        The Variable objects to be used for the calculation of the
        impact of the systematic uncertainty. The keys are the names of
        the variables and the values are the Variable objects
        themselves.
    _universe_weights : numpy.ndarray
        An array of weights for the systematic uncertainty. This has
        shape (nevents, nuniv) where nevents is the number of events in
        the sample and nuniv is the number of universes generated. This
        is not meant to be kept around for long periods of time due to
        memory concerns and is cleared internally by the `clear`
        method.
    _covariances : dict
        A dictionary containing the covariance matrices for each of the
        variables. The keys are the names of the variables and the values
        are numpy.ndarray objects representing the covariance matrices.
    _std : float
        The one-bin fractional uncertainty for the systematic parameter.
        This intuitively can be thought of as the uncertainty on a simple
        count of selected candidates due to the influence of the
        systematic parameter.
